                            <p class="sub-text">"I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best- and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers,working as a Software engineer at a VR startup."</p>

                                Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamps themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from them and learning from their experiences was easy.

                            <p class="sub-text">"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which i find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."</p>

                        Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sub-text">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a life of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend"</p>
